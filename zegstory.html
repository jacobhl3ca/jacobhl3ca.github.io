the story behind my art:

One day, on the desk at my family's home in NJ, zegzo was born. I even luckily took a timelapse[hyperlink this] of me creating him. People were naturally drawn into zegzo's allure, and it just accelerated from there. There were stories that my board members and I made up, heightening zegzo's existence. It gave him life, and a green flame lit inside of me. Zegzo is my artist tag, and I like to think that I embody his wisdom and spread it through my art. It stems from love, happiness, and kindness to all beings.
