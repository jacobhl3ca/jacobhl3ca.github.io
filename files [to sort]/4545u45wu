7/29/21 - 12/31/23: High Sargassum Advisory
It is expected that sargassum levels will be higher than usual. Sargassum is a free-floating seaweed that is especially prolific in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. While beneficial to ocean life, these large free-floating seaweed mats often wash up on beaches. The amount of seaweed on the beaches fluctuates based on the time of year and ocean currents. While resorts do their best to maintain the beaches for their guests, you may experience some inconvenience during your stay.
