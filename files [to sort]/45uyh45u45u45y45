I have the one with the base the has usb ports built in. I absolutely love it. Extremely sturdy build quality. Easy to adjust and assemble. I have two 27in monitors and there isn't even a hint of sag. You can adjust every movable part to preferred tightness. Going on two years and it feels as new as the day I bought it. Also has two covers to hide wires and can be used as either a dual clamp or grommet setup.

Edit: The model I own is the HNDS7
